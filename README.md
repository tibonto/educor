# EduCOR: An Educational and Career-OrientedRecommendation Ontology
## Context

EduCOR is an educational ontology for personalized recommendation learning systems that is based on a learning path and user profile. It represents the key components for a personalized learning system based on our requirement analysis.

## Abstract

With the increased dependence on online learning platformsand educational resource repositories, a unified representation of digitallearning  resources  becomes  essential  to  support  a  dynamic  and  multi-source learning experience. We introduce the EduCOR ontology, an edu-cational,  career-oriented  ontology  that  provides  a  foundation  for  representing  online  learning  resources  for  personalised  learning  systems.The ontology is designed to enable learning material repositories to offer learning path recommendations, which correspond to the userâ€™s learning goals,  academic  and  psychological  parameters,  and  the  labour-market skills  that  are  achieved  from  the  learning  path.  We  present  the  multi-ple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the real-life learning platform eDoer is discussed as a use-case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and task-based approaches. The comparison ofEduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use-cases,shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommenda-tions.
