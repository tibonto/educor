    <h2> Educational Resource </h2>
    <p class="lead"> This pattern represents the actual educational materials used to learn a specific Knowledge Topic (pattern D). Educational resources in EduCOR are described with three main classes and several data-type properties. An educational resource has one or more Quality Indicators. Each indicator can measure the quality of a specific feature of the educational resource. For example, a video educational resource can have a quality value of its content and another quality value for its resolution. Educational resources also have different Multimedia Types, including the most common four classes (Video, Audio, Image, Text). The educational resource can be accessed in different methods by different users. Therefore, the Accessibility class in this pattern is used to represent: 1) the accessibility needs of a certain user. For example, the font size requirements of a user with visual impairment. 2) the access rights of different users. This can be the case of an OER repository that allows accessing advanced materials for users who finished the basic ones, for instance. The Accessibility class is directly related to the User Profile (pattern G) for personalizing the user's access to educational resources.</p>
     <h2> Abstract </h2>
    <p class="lead"> With the increased dependence on online learning platforms and educational resource repositories, a unified representation of digital learning resources becomes  essential to support a dynamic  and  multi-source learning experience. We introduce the EduCOR ontology, an educational, career-oriented ontology  that  provides  a  foundation for representing  online  learning  resources for personalised learning systems. The ontology is designed to enable learning material repositories to offer learning path recommendations, which correspond to the userâ€™s learning goals, academic and psychological parameters, and the labour-market skills that are achieved from the learning  path. We present the multiple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the real-life learning platform <a href="http://edoer.eu"> eDoer</a> is discussed as a use-case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and task-based approaches. The comparison of EduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use-cases, shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommendations. </p>
