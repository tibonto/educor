    <h2> Educational Resource </h2>
   <img src="EduCOR-patternA" alt="Educational Resource Pattern">
    <p class="lead"> This pattern represents the actual educational materials used to learn a specific Knowledge Topic (pattern D). Educational resources in EduCOR are described with three main classes and several data-type properties. An educational resource has one or more Quality Indicators. Each indicator can measure the quality of a specific feature of the educational resource. For example, a video educational resource can have a quality value of its content and another quality value for its resolution. Educational resources also have different Multimedia Types, including the most common four classes (Video, Audio, Image, Text). The educational resource can be accessed in different methods by different users. Therefore, the Accessibility class in this pattern is used to represent: 1) the accessibility needs of a certain user. For example, the font size requirements of a user with visual impairment. 2) the access rights of different users. This can be the case of an OER repository that allows accessing advanced materials for users who finished the basic ones, for instance. The Accessibility class is directly related to the User Profile (pattern G) for personalizing the user's access to educational resources.</p>
     <h2> Skill </h2>
    <p class="lead"> The skill pattern is the direct connection, which EduCOR offers the user to the job market. It represents job skills that the user gains from learning the Knowledge Topics (pattern D). Therefore, a connection is drawn in EduCOR between the Skill class and Job Ontologies, to provide relevant concepts from the job market. It is also connected to the Domain Ontology, representing the domain concepts, e.g. unique skill-sets for a certain domain.
     Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object_metadata"> Learning object metadata LOM </a> model, each Skill has a classification, whose taxons can be traced back through their paths. We adopt this model to represent skills with different content or hierarchical order. The difference between skills might not be clear from the name, but rather the Learning Outcome of this skill, i.e. the actual use of the skill or skill-set. Therefore, the Skills class has a direct connection to the Learning Outcome class in Pattern E. </p>
        <h2> Test </h2>
    <p class="lead"> Test class in EduCOR is provided to cover the assessment tasks of Knowledge Topics (pattern D). A test is offered to the user (pattern G) in the form of one or more Questions. The user solves the Test by providing Answers to its Questions. Moreover, Questions and Answers can be framed in an Exercise class (pattern C) to group or categorise the tasks in one Test. </p>
